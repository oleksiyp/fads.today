The official Korean Central News Agency said Monday morning that the military had tested a medium-to-long range ballistic missile called the Pukguksong-2. KCNA said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the launch and watched from an observation post. South Korea and the U.S. earlier described Sunday's missile as medium-range. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it flew eastward about 500 kilometers, or 310 miles. KCNA said the purpose of the test was to verify technical indexes of the weapon system and examine its adaptability under various battle conditions before deployment to military units for action.","publishedAt":0,"title":"The Latest: North Korea confirms details of missile launch","url":"https://apnews.com/340c8330a327428abf7cc110cadf62a2","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:da93f83cdee94eb9b5b2612e7ac25fe8/3000.jpeg","score":10.635246,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"North Korea fired off an &quot;unidentified projectile&quot; Sunday according to South Korean defence officials, a week after its latest missile launch.","publishedAt":0,"title":"North Korea fires 'unidentified projectile' - Seoul","url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/21/north-korea-fires-unidentified-projectile-seoul/","urlToImage":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/05/14/TELEMMGLPICT000127795047-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVFtQMSn7ZYEgFkbAp9DEpxWLfs5mAvkbXYQqrLnBas.jpeg","score":10.288849,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"AFP","description":"North Korea fired off an \"unidentified projectile\" Sunday according to South Korean defense officials, a week after its latest missile launch.","publishedAt":0,"title":"North Korea fires another 'unidentified projectile'","url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-north-korea-fires-unidentified-projectile-seoul-2017-5","urlToImage":"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/59218473639147b7208b51da-1190-625/north-korea-fires-another-unidentified-projectile.jpg","score":10.288849,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"A mid-range missile launched by North Korea has a shorter range than those fired in three previous tests, the US says.","publishedAt":0,"title":"North Korea fires mid-range missile","url":"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-21/north-korea-unidentified-projectile-south-military-says/8545408","urlToImage":"http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8267252-1x1-700x700.jpg","score":10.288849,"fetchedAt":0}]
