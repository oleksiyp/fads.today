[{"author":"","description":"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A Shariah court in Indonesia's conservative Aceh province has sentenced two gay men to public caning for the first time. The court on Wednesday said the men, aged 20 and 23, would each be subjected to 85 lashes for having sexual relations. One of the men cried as his sentence was read out and pleaded for a lighter sentence. The couple was arrested in late March after neighborhood vigilantes in the provincial capital Banda Aceh suspected them of being gay and set out to catch them having sex.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Shariah court in Indonesia sentences gay couple to caning","url":"https://apnews.com/34e5a86e93da4a159429fb888ceba9ef","urlToImage":"","score":14.73945,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Mary Bowerman","description":"A massive sea creature that washed up on a beach in Indonesia last week isn't an unknown species from the depths of the ocean, but likely a whale, according to researchers.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Scientists identify mysterious sea creature that washed up in Indonesia","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/05/17/mysterious-sea-creature-indonesia-identified/327071001/","urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/640e4e5facbf866417b02b944660958bb292eb36/c=0-31-642-394&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/05/17/USATODAY/USATODAY/636306045113211952-Screen-Shot-2017-05-17-at-7.54.49-AM.jpg","score":14.706331,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"A conservation group says a rare albino orangutan rescued in Indonesia has been named Alba after thousands of suggestions were sent from around the world.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Public gives rare Indonesian albino orangutan surprisingly normal name","url":"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-16/rare-indonesian-albino-orangutan-named-alba/8531040","urlToImage":"http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8514788-1x1-700x700.jpg","score":7.642129,"fetchedAt":0}]
