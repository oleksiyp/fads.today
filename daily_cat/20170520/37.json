Fox offered no details on the case, but a lawyer for the employee said Beckel had \"stormed out\" of his office Tuesday when the man, who is a technician, came to do work on his computer, saying he was leaving because the worker was black. The lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, also said that Beckel attempted to intimidate his client and get him to withdraw his complaint in a meeting Friday with Fox executive Kevin Lord. Fox denied that anyone tried to persuade the man to withdraw his complaint, and said that Beckel had apologized to him after he was fired.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Fox News fires Bob Beckel for racially insensitive remark","url":"https://apnews.com/29ded93a597945568dd253d779d3e1c8","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:2d1a3b9bb19044d3a7d00d4b5d330114/3000.jpeg","score":21.681564,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Michael M.
