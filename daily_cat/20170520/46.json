[{"author":"P. SOLOMON BANDA and COLLEEN SLEVIN","description":"DENVER (AP) â€” A Colorado man ordered released from prison after being mistakenly set free a decade ago and then put back behind bars is now being held by federal immigration authorities and facing possible deportation to Cuba. U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement said Thursday that it took custody of Rene Lima-Marin, 38, after he was released from prison Wednesday. The agency is working to deport him to Cuba, a country he left as a toddler on the 1980 Mariel boat lift. Cuba generally only accepts deportations on a case-by-case basis so there's no guarantee Lima-Marin will be sent there.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Man freed from prison faces possible deportation to Cuba","url":"https://apnews.com/7065667738a74b83b766d8bb749dbf34","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:6dfbd59e23d5425293146de64f25f472/3000.jpeg","score":16.27654,"fetchedAt":0}]
