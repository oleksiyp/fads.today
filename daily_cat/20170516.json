(AP) — It's more than a feeling: Many of the rock 'n' roll bands that were huge in 1977 will comprise a big part of the summer concert market 40 years later. Queen, Foreigner, Boston, Aerosmith, Kiss, Alice Cooper, Billy Joel and Rod Stewart are among those launching major tours this spring and summer, even though some of them haven't had a big hit since Jimmy Carter (or at least Ronald Reagan) was in office. Concert industry executives say nostalgia acts are still reliable sellers, with satellite and classic rock radio keeping their hits alive.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Feels like the 1st time: many '77 rock kings still touring","url":"https://apnews.com/ba6c5f85b2ef42178e2b14559d9af247","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:692498761c034f22a72fe7522f32f792/3000.jpeg","score":2.626009,"fetchedAt":0}]},{"lang":"en","resource":"Bitcoin","statCounter":2821,"score":28.21,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Bitcoin_logo.svg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Bitcoin_logo.svg","label":"Bitcoin","categories":["en 2009 introductions","en 2009 software","en Alternative currencies","en Application layer protocols","en Bitcoin","en Cryptocurrencies","en Financial technology","en Words coined in the 2000s"],"position":29,"news":[{"author":"Hope Corrigan","description":"Hackers are demanding a large sum to be paid in bitcoin to not release the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film early.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Hackers Reportedly Holding Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Hostage, Demand Ransom - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/hackers-reportedly-holding-pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales-hostage-demand-ransom","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/05/15/pirates5-1280-1494891355415_1280w.jpg","score":6.1606903,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Reuters","description":"In one case, alleged hackers from North Korea demanded bitcoin in exchange for client information.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Researchers Think the WannaCry Ransomware Attack Is Similar to Those From North Korea","url":"http://fortune.com/2017/05/16/ransomware-wannacry-north-korea/","urlToImage":"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/aptopix-north-korea-f_ode.jpg?w=720","score":6.1606903,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Rory Carroll","description":"Hollywood Reporter says CEO Bob Iger has told employees that film would be released in segments online unless hackers were paid in bitcoin","publishedAt":0,"title":"Pirates of the Caribbean 5: hackers threaten to post film online unless Disney pays ransom","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/16/pirates-of-the-caribbean-disney-hackers-ransom-new-film-online","urlToImage":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08ba160039d52b358c69cc7e731498d37124741f/0_61_3632_2179/master/3632.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=adbf657f502437940f2ef9b98da3448e","score":5.5061164,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"By Amanda Ulrich For Dailymail.com","description":"Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a meeting on Monday that an upcoming Disney movie was being held for ransom.
