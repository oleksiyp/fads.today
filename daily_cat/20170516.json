(AP) — It's more than a feeling: Many of the rock 'n' roll bands that were huge in 1977 will comprise a big part of the summer concert market 40 years later. Queen, Foreigner, Boston, Aerosmith, Kiss, Alice Cooper, Billy Joel and Rod Stewart are among those launching major tours this spring and summer, even though some of them haven't had a big hit since Jimmy Carter (or at least Ronald Reagan) was in office. Concert industry executives say nostalgia acts are still reliable sellers, with satellite and classic rock radio keeping their hits alive.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Feels like the 1st time: many '77 rock kings still touring","url":"https://apnews.com/ba6c5f85b2ef42178e2b14559d9af247","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:692498761c034f22a72fe7522f32f792/3000.jpeg","score":8.142102,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Scarlet Howes","description":"WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: Schoolboy Billy Nethercot collapsed from drinking booze and smoking cannabis at a party","publishedAt":0,"title":"Shocking pictures of 13-year-old in hospital bed after drink and drug binge","url":"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-shares-shocking-pictures-13-10432221","urlToImage":"http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10432631.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/SWNS_DRUGS_OVERDOSE_013.jpg","score":8.116761,"fetchedAt":0}]},{"lang":"en","resource":"Gavin_Newsom","statCounter":1936,"score":19.36,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Gavin_Newsom_Lieutenant_Gov.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Gavin_Newsom_Lieutenant_Gov.jpg","label":"Gavin Newsom","categories":["en 1967 births","en Activists from the San Francisco Bay Area","en American Roman Catholics","en American beverage industry businesspeople","en American businesspeople in retailing","en American chief executives","en American investors","en American people of Irish descent","en American people of Scottish descent","en American restaurateurs","en American salespeople","en Businesspeople from the San Francisco Bay Area","en California Democrats","en Current TV people","en LGBT rights activists from the United States","en Lieutenant Governors of California","en Living people","en Mayors of San Francisco"," California","en People from Marin County"," California","en Russian Hill"," San Francisco","en Santa Clara University alumni"],"position":81,"news":[{"author":"Tony Romm","description":"They’ve filed another amicus brief backing Virginia high school student Gavin Grimm.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Apple, eBay, Microsoft and others are reviving their support in a transgender rights court case","url":"https://www.recode.net/2017/5/16/15644996/apple-ebay-microsoft-revive-their-support-in-transgender-rights-case","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-W9spWTuS5eBlKIChzfp1rqBscQ=/0x0:4862x2735/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54798185/618595308.1494949637.jpg","score":8.6533785,"fetchedAt":0}]}],"score":32.29013739065123,"scoreRounded":32},{"category":"","lang":"en","records":[{"lang":"es","resource":"Casa_de_Habsburgo","statCounter":2025,"score":20.25,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Familienwappen_Habsburg-Stroehl.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Familienwappen_Habsburg-Stroehl.jpg","label":"Casa de Habsburgo","categories":["es Casa de Habsburgo","es Familias de Alemania","es Familias reales"],"position":74,"news":[{"author":"Football Italia Staff","description":"Mattia De Sciglio will miss Milan&rsquo;s final two games of the season after suffering a thigh injury against Atalanta on Saturday.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Season over for De Sciglio","url":"http://www.football-italia.net/102635/season-over-de-sciglio","urlToImage":"http://www.football-italia.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/main_photo/[type]/[nid]/de-sciglio-down-epa140517.jpg","score":9.87248,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Andreas Busche","description":"Die „Phantome des Ismael“ und die azurblaue Wirklichkeit: das 70.
