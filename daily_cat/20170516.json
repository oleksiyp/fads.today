Americans have stepped up borrowing over the past three years, yet the nature of what Americans owe has changed since the Great Recession. Student and auto loans make up a larger proportion of household debt, while mortgages — the epicenter of the financial crisis — and credit card debt remain below pre-recession levels.

pieces of trash washed up on the beaches. Almost all of the garbage they found on Henderson Island was made from plastic. There were toy soldiers, dominos, toothbrushes and hundreds of hardhats of every shape, size and color. The researchers say the density of trash was the highest recorded anywhere in the world, despite Henderson Island's extreme remoteness. The island is located about halfway between New Zealand and Chile and is recognized as a UNESCO world heritage site.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Scientists find 38 million pieces of trash on Pacific island","url":"https://apnews.com/0c47d7ffa7a24759987630ab07281a7e","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:e870240029284dc6bec7104708d5e667/3000.jpeg","score":11.145416,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"The beaches of Henderson Island are littered with more plastic debris than anywhere else in the world, a survey of the remote South Pacific wilderness finds.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Plastic debris turning remote South Pacific island into dump","url":"http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2017-05-16/plastic-pollution-on-henderson-island-in-south-pacific/8527370","urlToImage":"http://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/8527418-1x1-large.jpg?v=3","score":10.580528,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"A tiny, otherwise pristine island is smothered by our blast from the past: vast amounts of decades-old plastic from around the world","publishedAt":0,"title":"Remote Pacific island found buried under tonnes of plastic waste","url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2131051-remote-pacific-island-found-buried-under-tonnes-of-plastic-waste/","urlToImage":"https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/15190031/f1abbx.jpg","score":10.580528,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"David Ibekwe","description":"The island is in the path of the South Pacific Gyre - an ocean current.
