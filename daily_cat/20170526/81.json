But, speaking in Berlin, Streiter said Germany's current account surplus — the broadest measure of trade and investment flows — reflects economic factors that the German government can't directly do anything about. He said it was \"also caused by factors that cannot, or at least cannot directly, be influenced by economic or financial policy measures in Germany, for example the oil price, the euro exchange rate, but also structural factors such as demographic developments.\"","publishedAt":0,"title":"The Latest: Germany pushes back against Trump trade comments","url":"https://apnews.com/f6caa2867363437f9608e57f5a398d8a","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:202bcd24c21b45709617e330c33196af/2144.jpeg","score":10.616271,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Von FOCUS-Online-Autorin Pia Kienel, FOCUS-Online-Redakteurin Alina Bähr","description":"Was für ein Finale: Céline erkämpft sich den Titel „Germany’s next Topmodel 2017“.
