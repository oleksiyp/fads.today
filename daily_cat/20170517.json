Federal prosecutors unsealed a sweeping indictment Wednesday morning charging dozens of members and leaders of the brutal street gang with a variety of crimes, including murder. Acting U.S. Attorney Sandra Brown said the 127-page anti-racketeering indictment targets 44 members and associates of the gang, including the one-time leader of a Los Angeles faction of MS-13. Three people accused of murder could face the death penalty, she said.","publishedAt":0,"title":"MS-13 gang targeted in pre-dawn sweep across Los Angeles","url":"https://apnews.com/33cd098c518545ebba569945c600fb48","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:b6632bb3424b436d8818cbb83836b2e6/3000.jpeg","score":9.591111,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Phil Wahba","description":"Dick's Sporting Goods shares fall 13% as rivals' bankruptcies don't help","publishedAt":0,"title":"Dick’s Sporting Goods Fails to Capitalize on Sports Authority’s Bankruptcy","url":"http://fortune.com/2017/05/16/dickssportinggoods/","urlToImage":"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/dicks-sporting-goods-store-2016-gettyimages-591955490.jpg?w=720","score":7.6822486,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Mark Walton","description":"13 teraflops FP32 performance and 16GB of HBM2 for compute markets with money to burn.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Radeon Vega Frontier Edition: First AMD Vega GPU is for the pros","url":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/radeon-vega-gpu-details-price/","urlToImage":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/radeon_vega_frontier_edition_2-760x380.jpg","score":7.6822486,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Christopher Mele","description":"A 13-year-old boy from Texas took less than a second to answer the word problem in the Raytheon Mathcounts National Competition.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Math Champion Wins With Answer About Pecking Chicks","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/us/math-counts-national-competition.html","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/16/us/16xp-math/16xp-math-facebookJumbo.jpg","score":5.943135,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Ann Saphir","description":"Ramin Forouzandeh had applied to 13 PhD economics programs in the United States, but after President Donald Trump signed his first travel ban in January, the 25-year-old Iranian turned to Canada for other options.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Trump's travel bans spook some students, fan fears of broader chill","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-students-idUSKCN18C0BK","urlToImage":"http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170516&t=2&i=1184942065&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPED4F0ZL","score":5.1221046,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"I’m a surgeon.

Americans have stepped up borrowing over the past three years, yet the nature of what Americans owe has changed since the Great Recession. Student and auto loans make up a larger proportion of household debt, while mortgages — the epicenter of the financial crisis — and credit card debt remain below pre-recession levels.
