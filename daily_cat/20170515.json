(AP) — Still unbeaten, the Golden State Warriors have a few days to heal up again. Gregg Popovich's time will be spent working to get his San Antonio Spurs to wake up, before it's too late. And determine whether injured superstar Kawhi Leonard might be healthy enough to return from an ankle injury, too. Sure, the Warriors just pulled off a 36-point thrashing of the Spurs two days after squeaking out a 113-111 victory in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals — their second-largest postseason win behind a game from 1948 when the Philadelphia Warriors won by 39 at St. Louis.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Warriors, Spurs will try to use break to rest and heal again","url":"https://apnews.com/88b2698ad1854f1891a5a4a413bae753","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:78739d71218a48b1b79a06da3b0fb337/3000.jpeg","score":6.0516167,"fetchedAt":0}]},{"lang":"en","resource":"Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(film)","statCounter":1252,"score":287.4674510192871,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Guardians_cast.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Guardians_cast.jpg","label":"Guardians of the Galaxy (film)","categories":["en 2010s action films","en 2010s adventure films","en 2010s comedy films","en 2010s science fiction films","en 2014 3D films","en Alien abduction films","en American action comedy films","en American adventure comedy films","en American films","en American science fiction action films","en Comedy science fiction films","en Dolby Atmos films","en English-language films","en Film scores by Tyler Bates","en Films directed by James Gunn","en Films featuring Howard the Duck","en Films featuring anthropomorphic characters","en Films set in 1988","en Films set in 2014","en Films set in Missouri","en Films set in prison","en Films set on fictional planets","en Films shot in London","en Films shot in Los Angeles"," California","en Films using computer-generated imagery","en Guardians of the Galaxy films","en Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation"," Long Form winning works","en IMAX films","en Longcross Studios films","en Marvel Cinematic Universe films","en Performance capture in film","en Rotoscoped films","en Screenplays by James Gunn","en Shepperton Studios films","en Space adventure films","en Superhero comedy films"],"position":124,"news":[{"author":"Matthew Diebel","description":"A Texas man is suing his date for texting while they were watching a 3D showing of \"Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2\" at an Austin theater.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Texas man sues his date — for texting during 'Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2'","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/05/17/texas-man-sues-his-date-texting-during-guardians-galaxy-vol-2/101786452/","urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a3bc12adca1e4a78e5c2b76868ac619a4ec8e67d/c=0-476-1222-1167&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/05/17/USATODAY/USATODAY/636306129404140275-TEXTING-1-1-50BM1TNQ.JPG","score":22.960659,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Derek Lawrence","description":"He posed with a Poppins impersonator, playing off his popular line from the Marvel film","publishedAt":0,"title":"‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2’: Michael Rooker met Mary Poppins, y’all","url":"http://ew.com/movies/2017/05/16/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-michael-rooker-mary-poppins/","urlToImage":"http://i1.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/yondu.jpg?crop=0px%2C34px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1","score":17.567762,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"Oscar-winning film-maker will reunite with producer Harvey Weinstein for a film named after the day that Trump was named winner of the US election","publishedAt":0,"title":"Michael Moore filming Donald Trump documentary Fahrenheit 11/9","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/16/michael-moore-donald-trump-documentary-fahrenheit-11-9","urlToImage":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3049fca7b51a3884ed5cec1a592b32293d51e0f/0_114_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=478d6039a924099fcf651bbd4628cefd","score":11.773441,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Ashley Carman","description":"Mophie just put its Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus charging cases online, in case you had any doubt that the company would release accessories for Samsung’s flagship devices.

Almost all of the garbage they found on Henderson Island was made from plastic. There were toy soldiers, dominos, toothbrushes and hundreds of hardhats of every shape, size and color. The researchers say the density of trash was the highest recorded anywhere in the world, despite Henderson Island's extreme remoteness. The island is located about halfway between New Zealand and Chile and is recognized as a UNESCO world heritage site.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Scientists find 38 million pieces of trash on Pacific island","url":"https://apnews.com/0c47d7ffa7a24759987630ab07281a7e","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:e870240029284dc6bec7104708d5e667/3000.jpeg","score":6.4107814,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Leena Rao","description":"A number of new features for Google Photos.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Google Photos Poses Some New Challenges for Instagram, Flickr, and Shutterfly","url":"http://fortune.com/2017/05/17/google-photos-app/","urlToImage":"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/google-photoscan.png?w=720","score":6.3765216,"fetchedAt":0}]},{"lang":"en","resource":"Asp_(fish)","statCounter":3500,"score":243.0065631866455,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Aspius_aspius.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Aspius_aspius.jpg","label":"Asp (fish)","categories":["en Animals described in 1758","en Fish of Asia","en Fish of Europe","en Fish of Russia","en Fish of the Caspian Sea","en Freshwater fish of Europe","en Leuciscinae"],"position":38,"news":[{"author":"","description":"Rays, and possibly sharks, could suffer reproductive loss from being dragged around by fishing nets before being released","publishedAt":0,"title":"Pregnant rays tangled in trawler nets have small, sickly babies","url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2131280-pregnant-rays-tangled-in-trawler-nets-have-small-sickly-babies/","urlToImage":"https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16155432/southern-fiddler-ray-trygonorrhina-dumerilii-st-leonards-port-phillip-bay-victoria-581732-large.jpg","score":6.9430447,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"BBC News","description":"A fishing ban extension is said to be the best hope for the world's most endangered marine species.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Rare Mexican porpoise faces 'imminent extinction'","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39923383","urlToImage":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9BEC/production/_96061993_flipnicklinmindenpictureswwf2.jpg","score":6.9430447,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Ellen Nakashima, Craig Timberg, Ellen Nakashima, Craig Timberg","description":"One former employee said the hacking tool was so powerful it was like “fishing with dynamite.”","publishedAt":0,"title":"NSA officials worried about the day its potent hacking tool would get loose.
