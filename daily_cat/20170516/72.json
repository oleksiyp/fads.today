Where many see the crumbling polar ice caps as a distressing sign of global warming, the National Advisor Bureau Limited sees it as a source of profit, and a way of offsetting the effects of climate change in the increasingly sweltering Gulf. The firm has drawn up plans to harvest icebergs in the southern Indian Ocean and tow them 9,200 kilometers (5,700 miles) away to the Gulf, where they could be melted down for freshwater and marketed as a tourist attraction.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Dubai firm dreams of harvesting icebergs for water","url":"https://apnews.com/f5b2b9d22d4d4921829e2a6e36491a41","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:87f541f4caa746f4a95ed60a22e5e47e/3000.jpeg","score":13.332743,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"AYA BATRAWY","description":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia is making every effort to dazzle and impress President Donald Trump on his first overseas trip, seizing on the visit to cement itself as a major player on the world stage and shove aside rival Iran.

THE SUPREME LEADER'S POWER At the heart of Iran's complex power-sharing government created after its 1979 Islamic Revolution is the supreme leader, a position now held by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The supreme leader also serves as the country's commander in chief over its military and the powerful Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force involved in the war in Syria and the battle against the Islamic State group militants in Iraq that also has vast economic holdings across Iran. An 88-member elected clerical panel called the Assembly of Experts appoints the supreme leader and can remove one as well, though that's never happened.","publishedAt":0,"title":"AP Explains: Voting, governance and clerical power in Iran","url":"https://apnews.com/539986cd08df4a88bdb21417c31df66f","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:ce643d38d1b44eec962dc10722fd0980/3000.jpeg","score":2.3865075,"fetchedAt":0}]
