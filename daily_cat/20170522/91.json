The 13-1 long shot was one of five fresh horses in the race that didn't run two weeks ago in the Kentucky Derby. Derby winner Always Dreaming and Classic Empire dueled for most of the race before Classic Empire stuck his nose in front midway on the far turn. It looked as if Classic Empire would go on to win, but Cloud Computing ran him down on the outside. Always Dreaming faded to eighth in the 10-horse field on a cool and cloudy day at Pimlico. A record crowd of 140,327 was on hand.","publishedAt":0,"title":"13-1 shot Cloud Computing springs upset in Preakness","url":"https://apnews.com/cbb7f86dc2aa44cc988c480f01cfb5ca","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:2817e2531e734eb4ab8201675f34df42/3000.jpeg","score":19.793633,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Barry Werner","description":"Cloud Computing led the way in the second leg of the Triple Crown","publishedAt":0,"title":"Payouts for the 2017 Preakness Stakes | FOX Sports","url":"http://www.foxsports.com/horse-racing/story/payoutr-for-the-2017-preakness-stakes-052017","urlToImage":"http://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/05/usatsi_10066779.vresize.1200.630.high.0.jpg","score":14.454857,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Heather DinichESPN Senior Writer ","description":"We knew there would be disappointment and anguish if Always Dreaming failed to win the Preakness, and there was.
