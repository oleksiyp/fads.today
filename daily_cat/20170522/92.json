Often, she ends up under the power of her son. From childhood through adulthood into old age, every Saudi woman passes from the control of one legal guardian to another, a male relative whose decisions or whims can determine the course of her life. Under Saudi law, the guardian's permission is required for a woman to get a passport, to travel abroad or to marry. It is also often demanded whenever a woman tries to do any number of things, including rent an apartment, buy a car, undergo a medical procedure or take a job. As a result, women are consigned to the legal status of minors.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Young or old, Saudi women live under male relatives' control","url":"https://apnews.com/bfda2be5460f4c8d8085746b6a9bec92","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:5116620975b44b91b48d0b973916ca21/2986.jpeg","score":5.343641,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"AYA BATRAWY","description":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — On his first overseas visit, President Donald Trump presided over a nearly $110 billion sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia that made clear his administration did not see the kingdom's human rights record or its devastating war in Yemen as an obstacle to restoring ties that had been strained under his predecessor. The military agreement with Saudi Arabia, effective immediately, could expand up to $350 billion over 10 years. It appeared to reverse an Obama administration decision to pull back sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi's armed forces over concerns sparked by a Saudi-led coalition bombing of a funeral hall in Yemen that killed more than 140 people.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Human rights concerns prove no obstacle in Trump-Saudi ties","url":"https://apnews.com/b180e554010942e19b62d8ccb2b05246","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:f38427f4ccac4f43a13040ad7f2e220e/3000.jpeg","score":5.343641,"fetchedAt":0}]
