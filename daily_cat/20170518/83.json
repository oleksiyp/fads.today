(AP) — Mel Brooks made it clear that he was not paid to appear at the premiere of the new HBO documentary \"If You're Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast.\" \"They never pay, they never pay,\" he joked. \"How funny I was tonight and I don't get a penny.\" Brooks stole the show from fellow Hollywood legends Carl Reiner, Dick Van Dyke and Norman Lear, with whom he shared the stage after the screening Wednesday. The four longtime friends star in the film, which explores what makes for a vibrant, active life after age 90. Non-famous nonagenarians and centenarians are also featured, including a 101-year-old competitive runner, a 100-year-old pianist and a 98-year-old yoga teacher.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Brooks, Reiner, Lear, Van Dyke discuss living well after 90","url":"https://apnews.com/5c06bfa8a2f546c29c349202ff31e6c7","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:787ac7c4cc6748c39a5a23a10f7b6ca6/3000.jpeg","score":8.880542,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Ben Glaze","description":"Two shackled prisoners had been unloaded from a van in Abu Kamal, eastern Syria, with a crowd set to witness the execution","publishedAt":0,"title":"RAF drone stops ISIS double execution with Hellfire missile hit on snipers","url":"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/raf-drone-stops-isis-double-10432759","urlToImage":"http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10299782.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Syria-conflict.jpg","score":7.627313,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"talkSPORT","description":"Jose Mourinho has changed from a charismatic guy to ‘very dour’ since taking charge of Manchester United.
