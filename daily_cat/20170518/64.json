RUGABER","description":"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. household debt reached a record high in the first three months of this year, topping the previous peak reached in 2008, when the financial crisis plunged the economy into a deep recession. Americans have stepped up borrowing over the past three years, yet the nature of what Americans owe has changed since the Great Recession. Student and auto loans make up a larger proportion of household debt, while mortgages — the epicenter of the financial crisis — and credit card debt remain below pre-recession levels. Those changes suggest households are still cautious about taking on debt to fuel day-to-day consumption.","publishedAt":0,"title":"US households owe record amount, topping pre-recession peak","url":"https://apnews.com/ea545df0f31942588460fceb213b77e0","urlToImage":"","score":8.289604,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Michael Corkery and Stacy Cowley","description":"Nearly a decade after the 2008 credit bubble, Americans have accumulated a total of $12.7 trillion in debt — a new peak.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Household Debt Makes a Comeback in the U.S.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/business/dealbook/household-debt-united-states.html","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/17/us/17bank/17bank-facebookJumbo.jpg","score":6.856505,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Scarlet Howes","description":"Victim Paul Croft, 19, an expectant father of twin boys, died in hospital a week after he was found badly beaten in an alleyway","publishedAt":0,"title":"Heartbroken mum condemns 'wall of silence' that protected fiances's killers","url":"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-who-gave-birth-twins-10438485","urlToImage":"http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10438449.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PAY-CD15064556.jpg","score":6.2990036,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Natalie Evans, Lucy Clarke-Billings","description":"Two people were killed when the twin-engine Learjet 35 came down in an industrial area in New Jersey on Monday afternoon","publishedAt":0,"title":"CCTV captures horrific moment private jet crashes on approach to airport","url":"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/cctv-captures-horrific-moment-private-10430975","urlToImage":"http://i1.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10430971.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/CCTV-footage-of-a-plane-crash.jpg","score":6.2990036,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Sophie Evans","description":"He conspired with his then lover Myra Hindley to torture and kill five children in the 1960s - with three of their dead bodies being found on a moor in the Peak District","publishedAt":0,"title":"Twisted Moors Murderer's horrific crimes and sickening 51-year silence","url":"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ian-brady-dead-79-twisted-10430284","urlToImage":"http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10426845.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Moors-Murderers-Ian-Brady.jpg","score":6.147392,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Daniel Stacey","description":"Nepal is betting that a new energy gold rush borne of its thousands of rivers and craggy peaks will establish it as a major Asian electricity source.","publishedAt":0,"title":"In the Himalayas, a New Power Rises: Water","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-himalayas-a-new-power-rises-water-1495013404","urlToImage":"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-TL364_HIMAHY_TOP_20170515155732.jpg","score":6.147392,"fetchedAt":0}]
