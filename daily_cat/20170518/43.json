(AP) — A jury on Wednesday acquitted a white Oklahoma police officer who says she fired out of fear last year when she killed an unarmed black man with his hands held above his head. The family of Terence Crutcher burst into tears and expressed outrage after jurors found Tulsa officer Betty Jo Shelby not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the Sept. 16 shooting. About 100 demonstrators later gathered outside the courthouse and some briefly blocked a main street. \"Let it be known that I believe in my heart that Betty Shelby got away with murder,\" Crutcher's father, Rev. Joey Crutcher, said after the verdict was announced.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Jury acquits Tulsa cop in shooting of unarmed black man","url":"https://apnews.com/5d51d53808c04218a124a79fd84d3b25","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:a653e67ca1e94b55a0d979e5738e4217/3000.jpeg","score":7.2648544,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Christian Holub","description":"'Black Panther and the Crew' will end after six issues","publishedAt":0,"title":"Marvel cancels Ta-Nehisi Coates’ police brutality comic","url":"http://ew.com/books/2017/05/15/marvel-cancels-ta-nehisi-coates-police-brutality-comic/","urlToImage":"http://i0.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/black-panther-and-the-crew-2.jpg?crop=119px%2C1565px%2C1494px%2C786px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1","score":7.216779,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Liz Raiss","description":"Hawaiian shirts.
