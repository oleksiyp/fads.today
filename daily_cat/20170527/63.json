Kennedy was born 100 years ago Monday, and a new book recounts his brief but eventful presidency — and the style and wit with which he shaped the hopes of a generation — through day-by-day reports drawn from coverage at the time, right up to his assassination in November 1963. Kennedy's 1,036 days in office saw many crises, including the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, the Soviet Union's menace to West Berlin and, most dangerously, the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.

The most recent test, in June 2014, was a success, but that followed three straight failures. The system has evolved from the multibillion-dollar effort triggered by President Ronald Reagan's 1983 push for a \"Star Wars\" solution to ballistic missile threats during the Cold War — when the Soviet Union was the only major worry.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Leery of North Korea, US plans first test of ICBM intercept","url":"https://apnews.com/975e771261f24d6d8976a0e64736b49b","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:14a9a1d8f0e6429fb17bc9c21d6fde7a/690.jpeg","score":4.2183304,"fetchedAt":0}]
