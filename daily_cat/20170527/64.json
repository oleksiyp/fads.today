Money is beginning to pour in- NATO will be much stronger.\" NATO countries do not pay the U.S. or NATO directly. They spend domestically on weapons or other defense-related needs. The president supports ongoing efforts to push member countries to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense. Only five members currently meet the target, but the other nations are committed to the goal by 2024. Trump is meeting with leaders from the G-7 nations in Sicily.
