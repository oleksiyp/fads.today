(AP) — The Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus that has wowed crowds for 146 years with its \"Greatest Show on Earth\" is taking its final bow on Sunday. The circus' last show at the Nassau County Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, is sold out, and former circus performers will be in the audience. It's something of a reunion — or a funeral — for a production that's centered on bringing joy to the public. Ringling's parent company, Feld Entertainment, announced in January it would close the show, citing declining attendance and high operating costs.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Curtain falls on 'Greatest Show on Earth' after 146 years","url":"https://apnews.com/59a7bb136acc49dfb6086119cf71378b","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:d0b2d7a13b2f4bfab905951d74ee4621/3000.jpeg","score":8.560997,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"BBC News","description":"Ladies and gentlemen, children  of all ages, say goodbye to the  ‘Greatest Show on Earth’.","publishedAt":0,"title":"The Circus Leaves Town - BBC News","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/circus_leaves_town","urlToImage":"https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/vj/live/idt-images/shorthand-goodbye_big_top/facebook_vi2cq.jpg","score":7.523076,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Scott K.
