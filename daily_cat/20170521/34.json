In the capital of Riyadh, Saudi King Salman greeted Trump warmly and later presented him with the kingdom's highest civilian honor, a gold medal, during a ceremony at the grand Saudi Royal Court. Trump rewarded his Saudi hosts with a $110 billion arms package aimed at bolstering Saudi security and a slew of business agreements. Trump spent most of his first day abroad shuttling between opulent palace ballrooms with the king. The two were overheard discussing natural resources and arms, and Salman bemoaned the destruction caused by Syria's civil war. Trump is on a five-stop swing that will take him to the Middle East and Europe.","publishedAt":0,"title":"The Latest: Trump presents Saudis with massive arms package","url":"https://apnews.com/760fedd92e5e438ca7dba0037b9e6ff2","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:07b8d98b00c24afd9c586400d73c8694/3000.jpeg","score":10.820915,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Jeremy Diamond and Zachary Cohen, CNN","description":"President Donald Trump signed a nearly $110 billion defense deal with Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud on Saturday, signaling the United States' renewed commitment to its alliance with the Gulf kingdom and desire to bolster its counterterrorism partnership.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Trump signs Kushner-negotiated $100B Saudi arms deal","url":"http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/19/politics/jared-kushner-saudi-arms-deal-lockheed-martin/index.html","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170518203934-01-jared-kushner-0518-super-tease.jpg","score":10.299469,"fetchedAt":0}]
