(AP) â€” An enclave of former summer bungalows, where Nazi sympathizers once proudly marched near streets named for Adolf Hitler and other Third Reich figures, is being forced to end policies that limited ownership to people of German descent. The German American Settlement League, which once welcomed tens of thousands in the 1930s to pro-Nazi marches at Camp Siegfried on eastern Long Island, has settled an anti-discrimination case brought by New York state. The settlement calls for a change in the league's leadership and adherence to all state and federal housing laws.","publishedAt":0,"title":"New York enclave with Nazi roots agrees to change policies","url":"https://apnews.com/ecc73cc5bab54cdfa93124b0c8e5d18b","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:559c6fd3c5664e748b2becb33477ebc0/3000.jpeg","score":7.1090093,"fetchedAt":0}]
