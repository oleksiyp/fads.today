The violence erupted Tuesday night after the army raided the hideout of Isnilon Hapilon, an Abu Sayyaf commander who is on Washington's list of most-wanted terrorists with a reward of up to $5 million for his capture. The militants called for reinforcements from an allied group, the Maute, and some 50 gunmen managed to enter the city of Marawi.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Priest among 14 hostages taken in siege of Philippines city","url":"https://apnews.com/d7533b764de7457a872a0f3935cebb55","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:257fa563d72f442b8eb4abc18b3e7c65/3000.jpeg","score":9.291372,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"The Latest on the siege of a Philippine city that led President Rodrigo Duterte to declare martial law in the south (all times local):","publishedAt":0,"title":"The Latest: Duterte considering nationwide martial law","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/the-latest-hostages-taken-at-church-in-southern-philippines/2017/05/24/943a61ec-404b-11e7-b29f-f40ffced2ddb_story.html","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Online/2017-05-24/AP/Images/Philippines_Muslim_Militants_74451.jpg-60a67.jpg","score":7.0035996,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Al Jazeera","description":"Ongoing violence prompts 'mass exodus' from Marawi, a day after Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Mindanao: Churchgoers 'taken hostage' amid Marawi siege","url":"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/mindanao-churchgoers-hostage-marawi-siege-170524085829461.html","urlToImage":"http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/5/24/e77d50ec197f4786bf2d53077d4b7939_18.jpg","score":7.0035996,"fetchedAt":0}]
