The GOP bill would lower average premiums, but in part that would be because coverage would typically be skimpier. In a blow to Republicans, the nonpartisan analysts were also critical of 11th-hour provisions that GOP leaders had added to pick up votes and assure the bill's passage. Letting states get federal waivers so insurers could charge higher premiums for people with pre-existing medical conditions would mean those consumers would \"ultimately be unable to purchase\" comprehensive coverage at prices comparable to today's costs, \"if they could purchase at all.\"","publishedAt":0,"title":"House GOP health bill projection: 23 million more uninsured","url":"https://apnews.com/496544fde9cc4af9bfbf3874a8a45086","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:da67172befa04ade941fa5b23d1ad48b/3000.jpeg","score":3.8490758,"fetchedAt":0}]
