President Rodrigo Duterte has declared martial law in the southern third of the nation and warned he would enforce it harshly. The violence erupted Tuesday night after the army raided the hideout of Isnilon Hapilon, an Abu Sayyaf commander who is on Washington's list of most-wanted terrorists with a reward of up to $5 million for his capture. The militants called for reinforcements from an allied group, the Maute, and some 50 gunmen managed to enter the city of Marawi.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Priest among 14 hostages taken in siege of Philippines city","url":"https://apnews.com/d7533b764de7457a872a0f3935cebb55","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:257fa563d72f442b8eb4abc18b3e7c65/3000.jpeg","score":5.0933485,"fetchedAt":0}]
