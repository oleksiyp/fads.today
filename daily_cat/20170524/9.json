Irving took over in the second half and finished with 42 points despite playing on a tender ankle, LeBron James added 34 and the Cleveland Cavaliers moved within one win of an almost inevitable third date in the NBA Finals with Golden State by rallying to beat Boston 112-99 on Tuesday night in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals. With James in foul trouble, Irving was forced to do more than ever and he delivered, scoring 19 in less than five minutes and 33 in a 19-minute stretch.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Kyrie-markable: Irving's 42 carries Cavaliers past Celtics","url":"https://apnews.com/962cbc7506164d5b9edd6b8b0ef72685","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:e7ff83a249f34e0d809bb19afd39efa4/3000.jpeg","score":22.047085,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Nick Schwartz                    \n\n                                    \n                        @nick_schwartz","description":"Skip Bayless said Kyrie Irving proved he may be the real King of the Cavs.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe react to the Cavaliers' comeback against the Celtics | FOX Sports","url":"http://www.foxsports.com/nba/gallery/skip-bayless-shannon-sharpe-react-cavaliers-comeback-kyrie-irving-lebron-james-celtics-052417","urlToImage":"http://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/05/1-75.vresize.1200.630.high.0.jpg","score":15.833128,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Chris ForsbergESPN Staff Writer ","description":"While LeBron James and Kyrie Irving carried the Cavaliers after halftime, the Celtics couldn't respond, especially without their one true superstar.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Without Isaiah Thomas, Celtics crumble as Cavaliers' stars step up","url":"http://www.espn.com/blog/boston/celtics/post/_/id/4726162/without-isaiah-thomas-celtics-crumble-as-cavaliers-stars-step-up","urlToImage":"http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0523%2Fr212154_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","score":14.206891,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Dave McMenaminESPN Staff Writer ","description":"The Celtics had a 16-point lead in the second quarter, but a scoring eruption from Kyrie Irving has the Cavaliers up 3-1 after Cleveland won Game 4.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Irving, James turn the tables on Celtics with comeback of their own","url":"http://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland-cavaliers/post/_/id/4185/irving-james-turn-the-tables-on-celtics-with-comeback-of-their-own","urlToImage":"http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0523%2Fr212177_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","score":12.265815,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Zach LoweESPN Senior Writer ","description":"Zach Lowe goes deep inside the most dangerous version of the NBA's most dangerous play: Kyrie Irving and LeBron James in a 1-3 pick-and-roll.
