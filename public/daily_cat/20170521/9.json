(AP) — The Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus that has wowed crowds for 146 years with its \"Greatest Show on Earth\" is taking its final bow on Sunday.

It's something of a reunion — or a funeral — for a production that's centered on bringing joy to the public. Ringling's parent company, Feld Entertainment, announced in January it would close the show, citing declining attendance and high operating costs.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Curtain falls on 'Greatest Show on Earth' after 146 years","url":"https://apnews.com/59a7bb136acc49dfb6086119cf71378b","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:54655073204846de9472cdf801eed53b/3000.jpeg","score":8.852715,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"BBC News","description":"Ladies and gentlemen, children  of all ages, say goodbye to the  ‘Greatest Show on Earth’.","publishedAt":0,"title":"The Circus Leaves Town - BBC News","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/circus_leaves_town","urlToImage":"https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/vj/live/idt-images/shorthand-goodbye_big_top/facebook_vi2cq.jpg","score":7.6814623,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Scott K.
