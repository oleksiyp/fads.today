And improve coordination within the Coalition,” Stoltenberg said. “But it does not mean that NATO will engage in combat operations.","publishedAt":0,"title":"NATO joins the coalition to fight ISIS","url":"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nato-joins-the-coalition-to-fight-isis/article/2176644","urlToImage":"http://cdn.washingtonexaminer.biz/cache/1060x600-8772f283e1f4ecbc32fda08c0c397bac.jpg","score":14.46913,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Ivana Kottasova","description":"It's true that NATO countries are increasing their defense spending, but it has little to do with Trump.","publishedAt":0,"title":"NATO funding: How it works and who pays what","url":"http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/20/news/nato-funding-explained/index.html","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170301060332-nato-soldier-780x439.jpg","score":12.828625,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"HuffPost Video","description":"Ahead of the NATO Summit, we take a look at the alliance’s history.\nFor starters, it was established in 1949 with a mission of halting the spread of Sovi...","publishedAt":0,"title":"What You Need To Know About NATO","url":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-you-need-to-know-about-nato_us_592348bee4b034684b0ee081","urlToImage":"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/59234e5f2000003a0016e3c6.jpeg?cache=xl89im5ypp","score":11.922982,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Daniel Boffey, Jennifer Rankin","description":"President castigates 23 of 28 Nato members for failing to spend enough on defence, placing an unfair burden on US taxpayers","publishedAt":0,"title":"Trump rebukes Nato leaders for not paying defence bills","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/25/trump-rebukes-nato-leaders-for-not-paying-defence-bills","urlToImage":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d181ec50b138136ae0edbfd60810d5dc20f67f3d/0_101_3618_2173/master/3618.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=d14450e9c99dac5dfcf654e3a0d57586","score":11.922982,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Al Jazeera","description":"NATO set to discuss sending more soldiers to Afghanistan, but many in Kabul fear such a move could prolong war.","publishedAt":0,"title":"NATO troop increase plan draws criticism in Afghanistan","url":"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/nato-troop-increase-plan-draws-criticism-afghanistan-170525052520655.html","urlToImage":"http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2015/10/28/3e477b5152b64edabe5cb875cfd644f9_18.jpg","score":11.922982,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Ivo Daalder","description":"Ivo Daalder: At the summit in Brussels, NATO members will be looking for Trump to commit to the alliance and to acknowledge the threat posed by Russia.","publishedAt":0,"title":"What NATO needs to hear from Trump","url":"http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/opinions/trump-nato-summit-visit-daalder/index.html","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170524103734-03-trump-brussels-0524-super-tease.jpg","score":11.922982,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Jeremy Diamond, CNN","description":"President Donald Trump on Thursday will attend his first NATO summit alongside the 27 other members of the military alliance and join in the opening ceremony of the group's new headquarters in Brussels.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Trump at NATO: What to watch","url":"http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/25/politics/trump-nato-what-to-watch/index.html","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170412211952-03-trump-stoltenberg-0412-super-tease.jpg","score":11.780156,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump's first trip abroad (all times local): 4:48 p.m. President Donald Trump is lecturing members of the NATO alliance to pay their fair share on defense during a ceremony at NATO headquarters. Trump says NATO members must \"finally contribute their fair share\" and meet their obligations. The president has been urging NATO leaders to live up to a 2011 decision to increase spending on defense to 2 percent of GDP by 2024. Trump says 23 of the 28 member nations are not paying what they should and he says it's \"not fair\" to the people of the United States. He says many of these nations owe \"massive\" amounts of money from previous years.
