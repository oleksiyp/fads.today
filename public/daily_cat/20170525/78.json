NATO’s civilian leader noted that all 28 allies are already individual members of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and said now NATO as an organization will also be a member. “This will send a strong political message of NATO’s commitment to the fight against terrorism. And improve coordination within the Coalition,” Stoltenberg said. “But it does not mean that NATO will engage in combat operations.","publishedAt":0,"title":"NATO joins the coalition to fight ISIS","url":"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nato-joins-the-coalition-to-fight-isis/article/2176644","urlToImage":"http://cdn.washingtonexaminer.biz/cache/1060x600-8772f283e1f4ecbc32fda08c0c397bac.jpg","score":13.511194,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Daniella Diaz and Amanda Wills, CNN","description":"The President is in Brussels, meeting with world leaders at the NATO summit.

Trump says NATO members must \"finally contribute their fair share\" and meet their obligations. The president has been urging NATO leaders to live up to a 2011 decision to increase spending on defense to 2 percent of GDP by 2024. Trump says 23 of the 28 member nations are not paying what they should and he says it's \"not fair\" to the people of the United States. He says many of these nations owe \"massive\" amounts of money from previous years.
