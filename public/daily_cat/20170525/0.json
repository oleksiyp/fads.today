In an audio recording posted by the Guardian, the reporter asks the congressional candidate about the GOP's health care bill, which was just evaluated hours earlier by the Congressional Budget Office.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Reporter alleges GOP hopeful Greg Gianforte body-slammed him","url":"https://apnews.com/2a32fad9813a42a0ac167bdf34d9fadf","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:f5c83c037e324df5a79944e89d944af2/2000.jpeg","score":22.230816,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"https://www.facebook.com/hadas.gold","description":"“Get the hell out of here,” Greg Gianforte is heard yelling.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Reporter: Montana House GOP candidate  'body-slammed' me","url":"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/24/montana-reporter-slam-238799","urlToImage":"http://static.politico.com/b3/53/481d2e5442878993200f8b0bae68/170523-greg-gianforte-getty-1160.jpg","score":17.382206,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Seaborn Larson","description":"A reporter for the Guardian was allegedly assaulted by Greg Gianforte, the Republican candidate in the Montana U.S. House race, the reporter said via Twitter.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Reporter alleges he was ‘body slammed’ by Montana GOP candidate","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/05/25/guardians-ben-jacobs-alleges-greg-gianforte-body-slammed-him/344454001/","urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2e1c2811bcf4f76df2bf8def22a277e1366ad64e/c=0-21-307-194&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/05/18/GreatFalls/GreatFalls/636307092315722513-greggianforte.jpg","score":15.032888,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Julia Carrie Wong, Sam Levin","description":"Audio obtained of Greg Gianforte attacking a reporter on eve of special election to fill a congressional seat vacated by a member of the Trump administration","publishedAt":0,"title":"Republican candidate 'body-slams' Guardian reporter in Montana","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/24/greg-gianforte-bodyslams-reporter-ben-jacobs-montana","urlToImage":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f90ccb0e5c5bfd1549fca87ad112bb0983a06148/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=ab36d0df555ed3a6ad36917b7650d61d","score":15.032888,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Leslie Shaffer","description":"A Guardian reporter said Montana Republican candidate Greg Gianforte allegedly “body slammed” him in a taped interview.
