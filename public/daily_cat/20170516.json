Americans have stepped up borrowing over the past three years, yet the nature of what Americans owe has changed since the Great Recession. Student and auto loans make up a larger proportion of household debt, while mortgages — the epicenter of the financial crisis — and credit card debt remain below pre-recession levels. Those changes suggest households are still cautious about taking on debt to fuel day-to-day consumption.","publishedAt":0,"title":"US households owe record amount, topping pre-recession peak","url":"https://apnews.com/ea545df0f31942588460fceb213b77e0","urlToImage":"","score":8.639847,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Natalie Evans, Lucy Clarke-Billings","description":"Two people were killed when the twin-engine Learjet 35 came down in an industrial area in New Jersey on Monday afternoon","publishedAt":0,"title":"CCTV captures horrific moment private jet crashes on approach to airport","url":"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/cctv-captures-horrific-moment-private-10430975","urlToImage":"http://i1.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10430971.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/CCTV-footage-of-a-plane-crash.jpg","score":6.6373034,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Scarlet Howes","description":"Victim Paul Croft, 19, an expectant father of twin boys, died in hospital a week after he was found badly beaten in an alleyway","publishedAt":0,"title":"Heartbroken mum condemns 'wall of silence' that protected fiances's killers","url":"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-who-gave-birth-twins-10438485","urlToImage":"http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10438449.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PAY-CD15064556.jpg","score":6.6373034,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Daniel Stacey","description":"Nepal is betting that a new energy gold rush borne of its thousands of rivers and craggy peaks will establish it as a major Asian electricity source.","publishedAt":0,"title":"In the Himalayas, a New Power Rises: Water","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-himalayas-a-new-power-rises-water-1495013404","urlToImage":"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-TL364_HIMAHY_TOP_20170515155732.jpg","score":6.4800854,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Sophie Evans","description":"He conspired with his then lover Myra Hindley to torture and kill five children in the 1960s - with three of their dead bodies being found on a moor in the Peak District","publishedAt":0,"title":"Twisted Moors Murderer's horrific crimes and sickening 51-year silence","url":"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ian-brady-dead-79-twisted-10430284","urlToImage":"http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10426845.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Moors-Murderers-Ian-Brady.jpg","score":6.4800854,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Tim Harlow","description":"The Barron County Sheriff says a 46-year-old man was killed.
