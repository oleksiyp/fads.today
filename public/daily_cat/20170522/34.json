Bush was fired from his job at NBC after a 2005 video emerged of him engaging in offensive sex talk with then \"Apprentice\" star, Donald Trump. In an interview posted Sunday, Bush told The Hollywood Reporter the past seven months have \"been a roller coaster\" that included an apology to his three daughters.
