Celtic pride is very real. Avery Bradley's 3-pointer danced on the rim and dropped with less than a second left and Boston, blown out in the first two games of the Eastern Conference finals and playing without star Isaiah Thomas, stunned the Cleveland Cavaliers 111-108 on Sunday night in Game 3 to end the champions' 13-game postseason winning streak. Bradley's shot from the left wing — off a play designed by coach Brad Stevens — bounced on the rim four times before going down. It capped a furious, focused comeback by the Celtics, who trailed by 21 in the third quarter before rallying to tighten up a series that appeared to be over.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Bradley hits last-second shot, Celtics stun Cavs 111-108","url":"https://apnews.com/8a8792f183fc43eba0c78994205ae7a8","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:7132606b131e4d38a34b2edbe8d75ee8/3000.jpeg","score":6.5729017,"fetchedAt":0}]
