It was announced earlier in the campaign that this is Terry’s final campaign at Stamford Bridge, following a remarkably successful stay in west London. He remains the Blues’ most successful ever captain, and is regarded as possibly the club’s greatest ever player. His exit is not surprising, given his lack of game time under Conte, but the Italian is well aware of Terry’s impact at Stamford Bridge.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Chelsea FC news: Antonio Conte admits Blues will ‘lose a legend for this club’ when John Terry leaves","url":"http://talksport.com/football/chelsea-fc-news-antonio-conte-admits-blues-will-lose-legend-club-when-john-terry-leaves","urlToImage":"http://talksport.com/sites/default/files/field/image/201705/gettyimages-683426954.jpg","score":18.04196,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"talkSPORT","description":"John Terry says he could retire when his Chelsea career comes to an end this summer.

And the legendary centre-back capped his return to the starting XI by opening the scoring for the Blues. However, that was as good as his night got. Just seconds after scoring it was Terry's mistake which led to Etienne Capoue's equaliser, and all night long the 36-year-old defender was shaky at the back. The Blues conceded three times, and needed a late Cesc Fabregas goal to secure a 4-3 win.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Chelsea FC news: John Terry scores, but fans start to understand why 'past it' legend is leaving","url":"http://talksport.com/football/chelsea-fc-news-john-terry-scores-fans-start-understand-why-past-it-legend-leaving","urlToImage":"http://talksport.com/sites/default/files/field/image/201705/gettyimages-683442784.jpg","score":15.455773,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"George Pitts","description":"Harry Redknapp says it ‘would be a dream’ to sign John Terry and has told the Chelsea legend: “You can be manager of Birmingham in a couple of years if you come and play for me!” The former England captain is ending his 22-year association with the Premier League champions and he has previously stated his wish to continue his playing career.","publishedAt":0,"title":"'John Terry can be manager of Birmingham City in a couple of years if he wants to play for me!' - Harry Redknapp discusses Chelsea legend on talkSPORT","url":"http://talksport.com/football/john-terry-can-be-manager-birmingham-city-couple-years-if-he-wants-play-me-harry-redknapp","urlToImage":"http://talksport.com/sites/default/files/field/image/201705/gettyimages-683442356_0.jpg","score":13.377103,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"FourFourTwo","description":"Michy Batshuayi, Nathaniel Chalobah and Kenedy all start for Chelsea alongside captain John Terry against Watford.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Terry starts as Chelsea make nine changes for Watford","url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/terry-starts-chelsea-make-nine-changes-watford","urlToImage":"https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/johnterry-cropped_1llr5ertdvdmo1qu7kyg5lllhh.jpg","score":12.147696,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"FourFourTwo","description":"Antonio Conte has thanked John Terry for his help and has backed the defender to continue his career away from Chelsea.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Conte hails 'great man' Terry's positive influence","url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/conte-hails-great-man-terrys-positive-influence","urlToImage":"https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/antonio-conte-john-terry-cropped_mj1zsgni0c051nang1u850e2d.jpg","score":10.894364,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"FourFourTwo","description":"John Terry has hinted he could hang up his boots altogether once he leaves Chelsea at the end of the 2016-17 campaign.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Terry hints at retirement","url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/terry-hints-retirement","urlToImage":"https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/john-terry-cropped_ssnxobg2ygbv16bhk5f0cqx8e.jpg","score":10.894364,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"FourFourTwo","description":"Chelsea recorded a 4-3 win over Watford courtesy of a late Cesc Fabregas strike, with John Terry also among the goalscorers.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Chelsea 4 Watford 3: Terry on target as champions march on","url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/chelsea-4-watford-3-terry-target-champions-march","urlToImage":"https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/john-terry-cropped_1psdc6w0uqkbs1r7rmeroi2sea.jpg","score":10.894364,"fetchedAt":0}]
