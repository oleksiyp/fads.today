Almost all of the garbage they found on Henderson Island was made from plastic. There were toy soldiers, dominos, toothbrushes and hundreds of hardhats of every shape, size and color. The researchers say the density of trash was the highest recorded anywhere in the world, despite Henderson Island's extreme remoteness. The island is located about halfway between New Zealand and Chile and is recognized as a UNESCO world heritage site.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Scientists find 38 million pieces of trash on Pacific island","url":"https://apnews.com/0c47d7ffa7a24759987630ab07281a7e","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:e870240029284dc6bec7104708d5e667/3000.jpeg","score":6.5021544,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"Steve Hansen, the All Blacks head coach, is raising the pressure on the British and Irish Lions by questioning whether they will be able to deal with the expectation that will surround them on their tour of New Zealand, and has suggested that Warren Gatland, his opposite number, could struggle to maintain harmony within his squad once Test selections are made.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Exclusive interview -Steve Hansen: I doubt Lions can handle expectations","url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2017/05/15/steve-hansen-doubt-lions-can-handle-expectations/","urlToImage":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-union/2017/05/15/TELEMMGLPICT000128240564-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqlYXdoReDou1rh6FDytyjfcotgA2On1L3NUtV_q8DotQ.jpeg","score":6.2877946,"fetchedAt":0}]
