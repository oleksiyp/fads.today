[{"author":"JON GAMBRELL","description":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) â€” Donald Trump Jr. traveled to Dubai and met a billionaire business partner in the city-state, discussing \"new ideas\" as the Emirati's real estate firm still lists possible plans for future joint projects while Trump's father is in the White House. The Trump Organization has said it won't make new foreign deals while Donald Trump serves as America's 45th president. That didn't affect the Trump International Golf Club in Dubai's opening in February , while a previously planned Trump-branded golf course designed by Tiger Woods is still being built nearby.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Donald Trump Jr., Dubai business partner discuss 'new ideas'","url":"https://apnews.com/62438c4821aa46fb8b0a6aa604a543ca","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:980119040eda4a7da9701ba69c4e9a73/3000.jpeg","score":6.738574,"fetchedAt":0}]
