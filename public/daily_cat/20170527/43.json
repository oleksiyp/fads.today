[{"author":"LAURIE KELLMAN","description":"WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Zbigniew Brzezinski, who helped topple economic barriers between the Soviet Union, China and the West as President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, died Friday. He was 89. His death was announced on social media Friday night by his daughter, MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski. She called him \"the most inspiring, loving and devoted father any girl could ever have.\" Earnest and ambitious, Brzezinski helped Carter bridge wide gaps between the rigid Egyptian and Israeli leaders, Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin, leading to the Camp David accords in September 1978. Three months later, U.S.-China relations were normalized, a top priority for Brzezinski.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Carter national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski dies","url":"https://apnews.com/da478a71e6e64440a6baaadd92896d1b","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:ab396f60039943b0b13c919c3d7f5bb6/3000.jpeg","score":10.034349,"fetchedAt":0}]
