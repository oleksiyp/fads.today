Sure, the Warriors just pulled off a 36-point thrashing of the Spurs two days after squeaking out a 113-111 victory in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals — their second-largest postseason win behind a game from 1948 when the Philadelphia Warriors won by 39 at St. Louis.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Warriors, Spurs will try to use break to rest and heal again","url":"https://apnews.com/88b2698ad1854f1891a5a4a413bae753","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:78739d71218a48b1b79a06da3b0fb337/3000.jpeg","score":6.039519,"fetchedAt":0}]
