The services come more than a week after the 52-year-old Seattle native was found unresponsive in a Detroit hotel room hours after performing a show with Soundgarden. Coroner's officials have said a preliminary autopsy showed Cornell hanged himself. A full autopsy and results of toxicology tests are pending.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Cornell funeral to take place Friday; widow pens letter","url":"https://apnews.com/0220b99258234d479321ff8cc3be65fd","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:79990114f32a409085d8ca2a44eb9246/3000.jpeg","score":7.707939,"fetchedAt":0}]
