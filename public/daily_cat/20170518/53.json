There's no evidence directly linking the killings to each other, but collectively they are a grim signal that lawlessness and impunity continue to threaten the lives and work of journalists across much of the country.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Rash of media murders highlights deadly threats in Mexico","url":"https://apnews.com/3846384d46c042d58fbabf3a2091ae6c","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:a5ace16aff0744c8856c921ff33bae25/2597.jpeg","score":11.219466,"fetchedAt":0}]
