There's no evidence directly linking the killings to each other, but collectively they are a grim signal that lawlessness and impunity continue to threaten the lives and work of journalists across much of the country.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Rash of media murders highlights deadly threats in Mexico","url":"https://apnews.com/3846384d46c042d58fbabf3a2091ae6c","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:a5ace16aff0744c8856c921ff33bae25/2597.jpeg","score":10.819181,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Anthony Esposito","description":"The United States and Mexico pledged to step up efforts to beat the growing threat of fentanyl, a synthetic opiate up to 50 times more lethal than heroin blamed for the deaths of thousands of people in recent years, including rock star Prince.","publishedAt":0,"title":"U.S., Mexico bolster efforts to combat deadly tide of fentanyl","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mexico-drugs-idUSKCN18C2QE","urlToImage":"http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170516&t=2&i=1184997760&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPED4F1O0","score":9.756816,"fetchedAt":0}]
