In California, which relies on bees brought in from such places as Missouri, Montana and North Dakota to produce more almonds than any other place in the world, hives began to vanish overnight across several counties three years ago.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Bee industry buzzing: Stolen hives recovered in California","url":"https://apnews.com/2357ece59e2045babe67fe7202d6e6c8","urlToImage":"","score":9.090641,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Akin Oyedele","description":"Industrial real estate is emerging as a winner out of the crisis in brick-and-mortar retail.","publishedAt":0,"title":"An 'asset class du jour' is emerging out of the retail apocalypse","url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/retail-apocalypse-industrial-reits-in-demand-2017-5","urlToImage":"http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/591c42851442931f008b60ad-1190-625/an-asset-class-du-jour-is-emerging-out-of-the-retail-apocalypse.jpg","score":6.035317,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Adam Satariano","description":"Inside the strange courtship between industrial behemoths and Western video game studios.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Why Did a Chinese Peroxide Company Pay $1 Billion for a Talking Cat?","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-05-17/why-did-a-chinese-peroxide-company-pay-1-billion-for-a-talking-cat","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iBEjlDRmzWf0/v0/-1x-1.jpg","score":6.035317,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"How machine learning and artificial intelligence is improving the financial industry.","publishedAt":0,"title":"FinTech that mimics the human brain: it's not science fiction","url":"http://www.cnbc.com/advertorial/the-machine-economy/","urlToImage":"http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/04/07/104391826-Nasdaq_advertorial_thumbnail.1910x1000.jpeg","score":6.035317,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Casey DeFreitas","description":"Industry veteran JP Kellams to work specifically on the competitive gaming team.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Former Scalebound Producer Joins Madden Team - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/05/17/former-scalebound-producer-joins-madden-team","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/05/11/mad-18-1494536403822_1280w.jpg","score":6.035317,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Mathew Ingram","description":"The latest mistake feeds right into the TV industry's argument that Facebook is not to be trusted.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Facebook’s Latest Ad Measurement Error Comes at the Worst Possible Time","url":"http://fortune.com/2017/05/17/facebook-measurement-error/","urlToImage":"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mark-zuckerberg-immigration.jpg?w=720","score":6.035317,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Spencer Kent | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com","description":"A LearJet crashed in an industrial area of Carlstadt just short of the runway at Teterboro Airport on Monday afternoon, killing two crew members.","publishedAt":0,"title":"2 dead as jet crashes on approach to Teterboro","url":"http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2017/05/plane_crashes_in_carlstadt_several_buildings_catch.html","urlToImage":"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njcom_photos/photo/2017/05/15/22696897-large.jpg","score":5.207795,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"","description":"Jeremy Corbyn will go into the General Election pledging to nationalise key industries and take Britain back to the Seventies.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Labour manifesto for General Election 2017: Key points, policies and summary","url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/at-a-glance-key-points-leaked-labour-manifesto/","urlToImage":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/video_previews/f/v/fvnha1yje6w3qresytfnexq1wepnuujq-xlarge.jpg","score":5.207795,"fetchedAt":0}]},{"lang":"en","resource":"Bruno_Le_Maire","statCounter":2713,"score":1013.6885887145995,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Réunion_publique_Bruno_Le_Maire_Strasbourg_21_novembre_2014_01_(cropped).jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Réunion_publique_Bruno_Le_Maire_Strasbourg_21_novembre_2014_01_(cropped).jpg","label":"Bruno Le Maire","categories":["en École Normale Supérieure alumni","en École nationale d'administration alumni","en 1969 births","en 21st-century French politicians","en French Ministers of Agriculture","en Living people","en Members of the National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic","en People from Neuilly-sur-Seine","en Sciences Po alumni","en Union for a Popular Movement politicians"],"position":22,"news":[{"author":"Alle Beiträge von ap  anzeigen.","description":"Der neue französische Staatspräsident Emmanuel Macron hat sein Kabinett zusammengestellt.

The actor Michael Douglas brought attention to this risk several years ago when he blamed his cancer on it. This is the first study of whether the vaccine might prevent oral HPV infections in young men, and the results suggest it can.

Federal prosecutors unsealed a sweeping indictment Wednesday morning charging dozens of members and leaders of the brutal street gang with a variety of crimes, including murder. Acting U.S. Attorney Sandra Brown said the 127-page anti-racketeering indictment targets 44 members and associates of the gang, including the one-time leader of a Los Angeles faction of MS-13. Three people accused of murder could face the death penalty, she said.","publishedAt":0,"title":"MS-13 gang targeted in pre-dawn sweep across Los Angeles","url":"https://apnews.com/33cd098c518545ebba569945c600fb48","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:b6632bb3424b436d8818cbb83836b2e6/3000.jpeg","score":20.488926,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Phil Wahba","description":"Dick's Sporting Goods shares fall 13% as rivals' bankruptcies don't help","publishedAt":0,"title":"Dick’s Sporting Goods Fails to Capitalize on Sports Authority’s Bankruptcy","url":"http://fortune.com/2017/05/16/dickssportinggoods/","urlToImage":"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/dicks-sporting-goods-store-2016-gettyimages-591955490.jpg?w=720","score":7.5512137,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Mark Walton","description":"13 teraflops FP32 performance and 16GB of HBM2 for compute markets with money to burn.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Radeon Vega Frontier Edition: First AMD Vega GPU is for the pros","url":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/radeon-vega-gpu-details-price/","urlToImage":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/radeon_vega_frontier_edition_2-760x380.jpg","score":7.5512137,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Christopher Mele","description":"A 13-year-old boy from Texas took less than a second to answer the word problem in the Raytheon Mathcounts National Competition.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Math Champion Wins With Answer About Pecking Chicks","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/us/math-counts-national-competition.html","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/16/us/16xp-math/16xp-math-facebookJumbo.jpg","score":5.835468,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Charlie Savage","description":"Ms. Manning is to be released from military prison on Wednesday.
