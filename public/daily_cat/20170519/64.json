CALDWELL","description":"LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Hundreds of federal and local law enforcement fanned out across Los Angeles in pre-dawn sweeps, serving arrest and search warrants as part of a three-year investigation into the ultra-violent street gang MS-13. Federal prosecutors unsealed a sweeping indictment Wednesday morning charging dozens of members and leaders of the brutal street gang with a variety of crimes, including murder. Acting U.S. Attorney Sandra Brown said the 127-page anti-racketeering indictment targets 44 members and associates of the gang, including the one-time leader of a Los Angeles faction of MS-13. Three people accused of murder could face the death penalty, she said.","publishedAt":0,"title":"MS-13 gang targeted in pre-dawn sweep across Los Angeles","url":"https://apnews.com/33cd098c518545ebba569945c600fb48","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:b6632bb3424b436d8818cbb83836b2e6/3000.jpeg","score":21.669312,"fetchedAt":0}]
