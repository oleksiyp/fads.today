(AP) — It's more than a feeling: Many of the rock 'n' roll bands that were huge in 1977 will comprise a big part of the summer concert market 40 years later. Queen, Foreigner, Boston, Aerosmith, Kiss, Alice Cooper, Billy Joel and Rod Stewart are among those launching major tours this spring and summer, even though some of them haven't had a big hit since Jimmy Carter (or at least Ronald Reagan) was in office. Concert industry executives say nostalgia acts are still reliable sellers, with satellite and classic rock radio keeping their hits alive.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Feels like the 1st time: many '77 rock kings still touring","url":"https://apnews.com/ba6c5f85b2ef42178e2b14559d9af247","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:692498761c034f22a72fe7522f32f792/3000.jpeg","score":2.6251974,"fetchedAt":0}]},{"lang":"en","resource":"John_Terry","statCounter":1520,"score":15.2,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/JohnTerry.JPG?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/JohnTerry.JPG","label":"John Terry","categories":["en 1980 births","en 2006 FIFA World Cup players","en 2010 FIFA World Cup players","en Association football central defenders","en Chelsea F.C. players","en England international footballers","en England under-21 international footballers","en English footballers","en Living people","en Nottingham Forest F.C. players","en People acquitted of crimes","en People from Barking","en Premier League players","en Race-related controversies in the United Kingdom","en Senrab F.C. players","en Sportspeople from London","en The Football League players","en UEFA Euro 2004 players","en UEFA Euro 2012 players","en West Ham United F.C. players"],"position":98,"news":[{"author":"FourFourTwo","description":"John Terry is yet to decide on his next career move and Swansea City will approach the defender with a view to bringing him to Wales.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Swansea will pursue move for Chelsea captain John Terry","url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/swansea-will-pursue-move-chelsea-captain-john-terry","urlToImage":"https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/john-terry-chelsea-watford-premier-league-15052017_apicsv7dkmgo1sqhzlgfa3x5z.jpg","score":23.745457,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"BBC Sport","description":"Chelsea captain John Terry says he could retire at the end of the season after leading out the champions in a 4-3 win over Watford.","publishedAt":0,"title":"John Terry: Chelsea captain could retire after leaving champions in summer","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39930942","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/7450/production/_96067792_terry_rex.jpg","score":20.84779,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"FourFourTwo","description":"John Terry has hinted he could hang up his boots altogether once he leaves Chelsea at the end of the 2016-17 campaign.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Terry hints at retirement","url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/terry-hints-retirement","urlToImage":"https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/john-terry-cropped_ssnxobg2ygbv16bhk5f0cqx8e.jpg","score":17.98622,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"FourFourTwo","description":"Michy Batshuayi, Nathaniel Chalobah and Kenedy all start for Chelsea alongside captain John Terry against Watford.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Terry starts as Chelsea make nine changes for Watford","url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/terry-starts-chelsea-make-nine-changes-watford","urlToImage":"https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/johnterry-cropped_1llr5ertdvdmo1qu7kyg5lllhh.jpg","score":17.95302,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"talkSPORT","description":"Antonio Conte believes a ‘legend for this club’ will be leaving Chelsea when John Terry departs Stamford Bridge at the end of this season.
