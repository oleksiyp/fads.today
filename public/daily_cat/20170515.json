Concert industry executives say nostalgia acts are still reliable sellers, with satellite and classic rock radio keeping their hits alive.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Feels like the 1st time: many '77 rock kings still touring","url":"https://apnews.com/ba6c5f85b2ef42178e2b14559d9af247","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:692498761c034f22a72fe7522f32f792/3000.jpeg","score":2.626009,"fetchedAt":0}]}],"score":31.13983776208107,"scoreRounded":31},{"category":"Other","lang":"en","records":[{"lang":"es","resource":"Agua_dulce","statCounter":38027,"score":380.27,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg","label":"Agua dulce","categories":["es Agua","es Ecología acuática","es Hidrología"],"position":1,"news":[]},{"lang":"de","resource":"Marx_Brothers","statCounter":21921,"score":219.21,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Marx_Brothers_1931.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Marx_Brothers_1931.jpg","label":"Marx Brothers","categories":["de Geschwister","de Komiker","de Marx Brothers","de Pataphysik"],"position":2,"news":[{"author":"BBC News","description":"Alan Bennett, whose brother Keith was murdered by Ian Brady, says he feels no sense of celebration.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Ian Brady death: 'Lost chance' to find Keith Bennett's body","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-39933184","urlToImage":"https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/D4D6/production/_96068445_brady_65_pa.jpg","score":6.744032,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"BBC News","description":"Alan Bennett, whose brother Keith was murdered by Ian Brady, says he feels no sense of celebration.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Ian Brady death: 'Lost chance' to find Keith Bennett's body","url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-39933184","urlToImage":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/D4D6/production/_96068445_brady_65_pa.jpg","score":6.744032,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Steve Robson","description":"Terry Kilbride, whose brother John, 12, was also murdered by Brady, begged him to tell police where he dumped the body of Keith Bennett, who went missing aged 12 in 1964","publishedAt":0,"title":"Moors Murders victim's brother had begged Ian Brady to reveal where body hidden","url":"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brother-moors-murders-victim-begs-10425005","urlToImage":"http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9477373.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Ian-Brady.jpg","score":5.181509,"fetchedAt":0}]},{"lang":"de","resource":"Warner_Bros._Entertainment","statCounter":19038,"score":190.38,"thumbnail":"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/WarnerBros-Studio.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/WarnerBros-Studio.jpg","label":"Warner Bros.
