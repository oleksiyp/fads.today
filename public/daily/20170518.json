ORSI and MARIA VERZA","description":"MEXICO CITY (AP) — A journalist is shot dead as she pulls out of her garage in the morning with her young son. Gunmen ambush another journalist while he lazes in a car wash hammock. An award-winning reporter is hauled out of his vehicle and gunned down a block from his office. On Monday, Javier Valdez became the sixth journalist slain in Mexico since early March, a deadly spree unusual even in a country that ranks behind only Syria and Afghanistan for such murders. There's no evidence directly linking the killings to each other, but collectively they are a grim signal that lawlessness and impunity continue to threaten the lives and work of journalists across much of the country.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Rash of media murders highlights deadly threats in Mexico","url":"https://apnews.com/3846384d46c042d58fbabf3a2091ae6c","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:a5ace16aff0744c8856c921ff33bae25/2597.jpeg","score":10.834726,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Anthony Esposito","description":"The United States and Mexico pledged to step up efforts to beat the growing threat of fentanyl, a synthetic opiate up to 50 times more lethal than heroin blamed for the deaths of thousands of people in recent years, including rock star Prince.","publishedAt":0,"title":"U.S., Mexico bolster efforts to combat deadly tide of fentanyl","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mexico-drugs-idUSKCN18C2QE","urlToImage":"http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170516&t=2&i=1184997760&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPED4F1O0","score":9.766624,"fetchedAt":0}],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"de","resource":"Gzuz","statCounter":1656,"score":16.56,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Gzuz_und_Bonez_MC_-_Pusher_Apparel.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Gzuz_und_Bonez_MC_-_Pusher_Apparel.jpg","label":"Gzuz","categories":["de Deutscher","de Geboren 1988","de Mann","de Musiker (Hamburg)","de Pseudonym","de Rapper (Deutschland)"],"position":0,"news":[],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"en","resource":"Kotlin_(programming_language)","statCounter":1649,"score":16.49,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Kotlin-logo.png?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Kotlin-logo.png","label":"Kotlin (programming language)","categories":["en JVM programming languages","en Java platform","en Java programming language family","en Object-oriented programming languages","en Programming languages","en Programming languages created in 2011","en Software using the Apache license","en Statically typed programming languages"],"position":0,"news":[{"author":"Paul Miller","description":"Google just announced that it will officially support Kotlin on Android as a “first-class” language.
