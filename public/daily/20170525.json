In recent months, member nations have strained to show they are ramping up defense spending as Trump has demanded, even though they have been doing so for a few years in response to an aggressive Russia. And while they agree with the chief of the alliance's most powerful member that NATO can do more to fight terrorism, they say it can be achieved with more of the same; training and mentoring troops in Afghanistan, and equipping local forces in Iraq so they can better fight the Islamic State group themselves.","publishedAt":0,"title":"NATO rolls out the red carpet, buffs its image for Trump","url":"https://apnews.com/1e412fe9983747a6a8f94a2356d31f96","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:46bfeb4eec4b41a6a85c39e544a46e3c/2160.jpeg","score":7.0060916,"fetchedAt":0}],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"en","resource":"Twin_Peaks","statCounter":1363,"score":13.63,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Sheryl_Lee.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Sheryl_Lee.jpg","label":"Twin Peaks","categories":["en 1989 in fiction","en 1990 American television series debuts","en 1990s American television series","en 1991 American television series endings","en American Broadcasting Company network shows","en American drama television series","en American television soap operas","en Best Drama Series Golden Globe winners","en Dreams in fiction","en English-language television programming","en Fictional populated places","en Fictional populated places in Washington (state)","en Filicide in fiction","en Mystery television series","en Nonlinear narrative television series","en Paranormal in fiction","en Peabody Award winning television programs","en Serial drama television series","en Television programs adapted into films","en Television programs adapted into novels","en Television series by CBS Television Studios","en Television series revived after cancellation","en Television series set in the 1980s","en Television shows set in Washington (state)","en Twin Peaks","en Weird fiction","en Works by David Lynch"],"position":0,"news":[{"author":"Matt Fowler","description":"As Twin Peaks returns, here's a look back at the wonderfully twisted landmark TV series from David Lynch.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Why Twin Peaks Still Rules -
