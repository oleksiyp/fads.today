(AP) — The Latest on assault allegations against Republican congressional candidate Greg Gianforte (all times local): 10:35 p.m. Democrats are launching Facebook ads against Republican Greg Gianforte over his alleged body-slamming of a reporter. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced the spots late Wednesday. It's an almost instant turnaround before polls close Thursday evening. The Democratic committee said it hopes to target Democrats who were otherwise unlikely to vote in the special election. The committee said it will spend \"the maximum amount of money allowable\" behind ads targeting the state's Democrats. The spot includes the audio recording made by reporter Ben Jacobs as Gianforte allegedly slammed him to the ground. Fox News says a crew saw Gianforte grab Jacobs by the neck and slam him to the ground. Gianforte's campaign says the two fell to the ground together while fighting over a recorder. Gallatin County Sheriff Brian Gootkin said authorities are investigating.","publishedAt":0,"title":"The Latest: Democrats launch ads on Montana
