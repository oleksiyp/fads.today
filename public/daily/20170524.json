As details of the attack in Marawi city emerged, fears mounted that the largest Roman Catholic nation in Asia could be falling into a growing list of countries grappling with the spread of influence from the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Islamic State-linked militants besiege Philippine city","url":"https://apnews.com/d7533b764de7457a872a0f3935cebb55","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:fa15449c481448be8f86f53a46aed4f9/3000.jpeg","score":4.9895525,"fetchedAt":0}],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"pl","resource":"Antoni_Cierplikowski","statCounter":1740,"score":17.4,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Nagrobek_antoine_sieradz.JPG?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Nagrobek_antoine_sieradz.JPG","label":"Antoni Cierplikowski","categories":["pl Ludzie związani z Łodzią","pl Ludzie związani z Sieradzem","pl Odznaczeni Krzyżem Kawalerskim Orderu Odrodzenia Polski (III Rzeczpospolita)","pl Polacy - Kawalerowie Legii Honorowej","pl Polonia we Francji","pl Polscy fryzjerzy","pl Urodzeni w 1884","pl Zmarli w 1976"],"position":0,"news":[],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"ru","resource":"Джугашвили,_Яков_Иосифович","statCounter":1734,"score":17.34,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Джугашвили_Яков_Иосифович.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Джугашвили_Яков_Иосифович.jpg","label":"Джугашвили, Яков Иосифович","categories":["ru Выпускники Военной академии РВСН имени Петра Великого","ru Выпускники МИИТа","ru Командиры батарей в Великой Отечественной войне","ru Персоналии:Грузия","ru Потомки Сталина","ru Родившиеся в Грузии","ru Советские военнопленные во время Великой Отечественной войны"],"position":0,"news":[],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"en","resource":"Jinder_Mahal","statCounter":1714,"score":17.14,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Mahal2014.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Mahal2014.jpg","label":"Jinder Mahal","categories":["en 1986 births","en Canadian Sikhs","en Canadian male professional wrestlers","en Canadian people of Indian descent","en Living people","en Male actors of Indian descent","en Punjabi people","en Stampede Wrestling alumni","en University of Calgary alumni"],"position":0,"news":[{"author":"Matt Fowler","description":"Backlash live blog updated with the winners of Randy Orton vs. Jinder Mahal, Kevin Owens vs. AJ Styles, and more.","publishedAt":0,"title":"WWE Backlash 2017 Live Blog and Results - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/05/21/wwe-backlash-2017-live-blog-and-results","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/05/20/backlashblog-1-1280-1495318960812_1280w.jpg","score":20.335995,"fetchedAt":0}],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"ja","resource":"ロジャー・ムーア","statCounter":1707,"score":17.07,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Roger_Moore.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Roger_Moore.jpg","label":"ロジャー・ムーア","categories":["ja イングランドの俳優","ja ジェームズ・ボンド","ja ハリウッド・ウォーク・オブ・フェーム","ja ランベス区出身の人物","ja 大英帝国勲章","ja 存命人物","ja 芸術文化勲章受章者","ja 1927年生"],"position":0,"news":[],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"en","resource":"Jennifer_Hudson","statCounter":1699,"score":16.99,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Jennifer-Hudson_2012-01-17_Barnes-Noble_Chicago_photoby_Adam-Bielawski_(cropped).jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Jennifer-Hudson_2012-01-17_Barnes-Noble_Chicago_photoby_Adam-Bielawski_(cropped).jpg","label":"Jennifer Hudson","categories":["en 1981 births","en 21st-century American actresses","en Actresses from Chicago"," Illinois","en African-American actresses","en African-American female singers","en American Idol participants","en American dance musicians","en American female pop singers","en American film actresses","en American mezzo-sopranos","en American rhythm and blues singers","en American soul singers","en Baptists from the United States","en Best Supporting Actress Academy Award winners","en Best Supporting Actress BAFTA Award winners","en Best Supporting Actress Golden Globe (film) winners","en Dunbar Vocational High School alumni","en Grammy Award winners","en Langston University alumni","en Living people","en Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role Screen Actors Guild Award winners","en RCA Records artists","en Singers from Chicago"," Illinois"],"position":0,"news":[],"newsCount":0}]
