ANGELES (AP) — Late Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell will be laid to rest Friday at a private memorial service at a Hollywood cemetery that is the final resting place of numerous stars. The private service at Hollywood Forever Cemetery will be followed by a public memorial that begins at 3 p.m. PDT, during which fans can view Cornell's burial site. The services come more than a week after the 52-year-old Seattle native was found unresponsive in a Detroit hotel room hours after performing a show with Soundgarden. Coroner's officials have said a preliminary autopsy showed Cornell hanged himself.
