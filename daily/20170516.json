Almost all of the garbage they found on Henderson Island was made from plastic. There were toy soldiers, dominos, toothbrushes and hundreds of hardhats of every shape, size and color. The researchers say the density of trash was the highest recorded anywhere in the world, despite Henderson Island's extreme remoteness.
