YORK (AP) — Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle is in conversations with the Trump administration about replacing Sean Spicer as White House press secretary. The former first lady of San Francisco told the Mercury News in San Jose, California, on Monday that taking that job or having another press role in the White House has been \"raised by a number of people\" in the Trump administration. \"I'm a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country,\" Guilfoyle said. \"I think it'd be a fascinating job. It's a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position.\"","publishedAt":0,"title":"Fox News' Guilfoyle up for White House press secretary job","url":"https://apnews.com/4785a245daa14877a4d7ee70631cd106","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:6670f020b8ab4ddc9ee2f665f093899e/2220.jpeg","score":8.165517,"fetchedAt":0}],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"ja","resource":"環水平アーク","statCounter":5497,"score":54.97,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CircumhorizonArcIdaho.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CircumhorizonArcIdaho.jpg","label":"環水平アーク","categories":["ja 光","ja 大気光学現象"],"position":0,"news":[],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"en","resource":"Asp_(fish)","statCounter":5448,"score":54.48,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Aspius_aspius.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Aspius_aspius.jpg","label":"Asp (fish)","categories":["en Animals described in 1758","en Fish of Asia","en Fish of Europe","en Fish of Russia","en Fish of the Caspian Sea","en Freshwater fish of Europe","en Leuciscinae"],"position":0,"news":[],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"pl","resource":"Biblia","statCounter":5358,"score":53.58,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Torah2.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Torah2.jpg","label":"Biblia","categories":["pl Biblia","pl Jezus Chrystus w utworach literackich","pl Literatura hebrajska"],"position":0,"news":[],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"en","resource":"H._R._McMaster","statCounter":5259,"score":52.59,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/H.R._McMaster_ARCIC_2014.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/H.R._McMaster_ARCIC_2014.jpg","label":"H.
