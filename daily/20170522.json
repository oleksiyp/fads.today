In the capital of Riyadh, Saudi King Salman greeted Trump warmly and later presented him with the kingdom's highest civilian honor, a gold medal, during a ceremony at the grand Saudi Royal Court. Trump rewarded his Saudi hosts with a $110 billion arms package aimed at bolstering Saudi security and a slew of business agreements. Trump spent most of his first day abroad shuttling between opulent palace ballrooms with the king.
