Duterte declared martial rule for 60 days in the entire southern Mindanao region, the restive third of the Philippine archipelago, Tuesday evening to try to crush Muslim extremists who have aligned themselves with the Islamic State group and occupied a hospital, jail and other buildings and battled troops in an audacious attack in Marawi City.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Duterte declares martial rule in besieged south Philippines","url":"https://apnews.com/a2d52f83b0a84117833f3f51729e7b96","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:d77f666f41d6469ab01ae093e07c9d75/3000.jpeg","score":7.0130568,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"JIM GOMEZ and TERESA CEROJANO","description":"ILIGAN CITY, Philippines (AP) — Islamic State group-linked militants swept through a southern Philippine city, beheading a police chief, burning buildings, seizing a Catholic priest and his worshippers and raising the black flag of IS, authorities said Wednesday.
