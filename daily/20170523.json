These are the top moments from the awards show. ___ DRAKE'S LUCKY 13","publishedAt":0,"title":"Drake dominates, Cher reflects at Billboard Music Awards","url":"https://apnews.com/5bc678a3187d4dd389b09c92fbfdbc2d","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:e900b2445bee40e9b171b7231facaf6c/2831.jpeg","score":5.649704,"fetchedAt":0}],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"en","resource":"Dubai","statCounter":1984,"score":19.84,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CollageDubai.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/CollageDubai.jpg","label":"Dubai","categories":["en Articles containing video clips","en Dubai","en Metropolitan areas of the United Arab Emirates","en Persian Gulf","en Populated coastal places in the United Arab Emirates","en Port cities in the Arabian Peninsula"],"position":0,"news":[{"author":"Football Italia Staff","description":"Cesare Prandelli has been appointed as the new Coach of Al Nasr Dubai Sports Club for next season, replacing Dan Petrescu.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Al Nasr Dubai appoint Prandelli","url":"http://www.football-italia.net/node/102850","urlToImage":"http://www.football-italia.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/main_photo/[type]/[nid]/Prandelli-shade-epa_3.jpg","score":14.765671,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Football Italia Staff","description":"Cesare Prandelli has been appointed as the new Coach of Al Nasr Dubai Sports Club for next season, replacing Dan Petrescu.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Al Nasr Dubai appoint Prandelli","url":"http://www.football-italia.net/102850/al-nasr-dubai-appoint-prandelli","urlToImage":"http://www.football-italia.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/main_photo/[type]/[nid]/Prandelli-shade-epa_3.jpg","score":14.765671,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"By George Odling For The Daily Mail","description":"Caren Harmon, 43, was flying with Emirates from London to Johannesburg  but when she disembarked at Dubai International for a connecting flight police were waiting for her.","publishedAt":0,"title":"UK woman held in Dubai over ‘false cocaine accusation’","url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4528196/UK-woman-held-Dubai-false-cocaine-accusation.html","urlToImage":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/21/21/40A19E4600000578-0-image-a-4_1495399761684.jpg","score":12.891331,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"Rachel Kaser","description":"A robotic police officer is making its debut on the streets of Dubai tomorrow night -- and I hope everyone there has watched Robocop.\r\n\r\nThe uniformed bot greeted visitors to the Gulf ...","publishedAt":0,"title":"Robot cop begins patrolling the streets of Dubai tomorrow night","url":"https://thenextweb.com/security/2017/05/22/robot-cop-begins-patrolling-streets-dubai-tomorrow-night/","urlToImage":"https://cdn3.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/05/Dubai-Robot-Cop.jpg","score":12.0214205,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"FourFourTwo","description":"Esteghlal left it late to claim a 1-0 first-leg win over Al Ain in the AFC Champions League, while Al-Ahli and Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai drew.","publishedAt":0,"title":"AFC Champions League Review: Esteghlal prevail in ill-tempered finale, Al-Ahli draw with Al-Ahli","url":"https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/afc-champions-league-review-esteghlal-prevail-ill-tempered-finale-al-ahli-draw-al-ahli","urlToImage":"https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/footballs-cropped_d18p1fqa5tns1tbkt4byp2rci.jpg","score":5.487145,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"JON GAMBRELL","description":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran's chief nuclear envoy, Hassan Rouhani earned the nickname \"diplomat sheikh\" when negotiators in 2004 reached a deal that saw the Islamic Republic halt all its enrichment of uranium.
