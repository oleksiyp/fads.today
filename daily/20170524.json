abruptly left Moscow to deal with a crisis at home sparked by a Muslim extremist siege on a city, where militants burned buildings overnight and are feared to have taken hostages. Duterte declared martial rule for 60 days in the entire southern Mindanao region, the restive third of the Philippine archipelago, Tuesday evening to try to crush Muslim extremists who have aligned themselves with the Islamic State group and occupied a hospital, jail and other buildings and battled troops in an audacious attack in Marawi City.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Duterte declares martial rule in besieged south Philippines","url":"https://apnews.com/a2d52f83b0a84117833f3f51729e7b96","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:d77f666f41d6469ab01ae093e07c9d75/3000.jpeg","score":7.165844,"fetchedAt":0},{"author":"JIM GOMEZ and TERESA CEROJANO","description":"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Muslim extremists abducted a Catholic priest and more than a dozen churchgoers while laying siege to a southern Philippine city overnight, burning buildings, ambushing soldiers and hoisting flags of the Islamic State group, officials said Wednesday. President Rodrigo Duterte has declared martial law in the southern third of the nation and warned he would enforce it harshly. The violence erupted Tuesday night after the army raided the hideout of Isnilon Hapilon, an Abu Sayyaf commander who is on Washington's list of most-wanted terrorists with a reward of up to $5 million for his capture. The militants called for reinforcements from an allied group, the Maute, and some 50 gunmen managed to enter the city of Marawi.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Priest among 14 hostages taken in siege of
