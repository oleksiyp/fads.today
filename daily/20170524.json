After spending their first eight months on the ranches of Gildardo Lopez Hinojosa, the calves are about to cross the border — bound for Texas and U.S. feed lots beyond. On one of the three bridges connecting Reynosa with Texas, they might cross paths with the beef and chicken shipments that Lopez imports from the U.S. for his local chains of butcher shops and fried chicken restaurants. He gets the best price for his calves in the U.S. and it's cheaper for him to import U.S. chicken than ship Mexican chicken from the country's interior.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Complex world of border trade: Cattle go north, meat south","url":"https://apnews.com/57792372666149f4b7dabcacb7f41f06","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:a181b213b01e457ab23670d6cacf90d5/3000.jpeg","score":2.2021093,"fetchedAt":0}],"newsCount":0},{"lang":"en","resource":"Twin_Peaks","statCounter":1823,"score":18.23,"thumbnail":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Sheryl_Lee.jpg?width=300","depiction":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Sheryl_Lee.jpg","label":"Twin Peaks","categories":["en 1989 in fiction","en 1990 American television series debuts","en 1990s American television series","en 1991 American television series endings","en American Broadcasting Company network shows","en American drama television series","en American television soap operas","en Best Drama Series Golden Globe winners","en Dreams in fiction","en English-language television programming","en Fictional populated places","en Fictional populated places in Washington (state)","en Filicide in fiction","en Mystery television series","en Nonlinear narrative television series","en Paranormal in fiction","en Peabody Award winning television programs","en Serial drama television series","en Television programs adapted into films","en Television programs adapted into novels","en Television series by CBS Television Studios","en Television series revived after cancellation","en Television series set in the 1980s","en Television shows set in Washington (state)","en Twin Peaks","en Weird fiction","en Works by David Lynch"],"position":0,"news":[{"author":"Matt Fowler","description":"As Twin Peaks returns, here's a look back at the wonderfully twisted landmark TV series from David Lynch.","publishedAt":0,"title":"Why Twin Peaks Still Rules -
